# Loan Management Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CSV Export Limited to Only 5-6 Columns
**Problem**: The export functionality was only exporting a hardcoded set of columns (Name, Email, Phone, Status, Loan Amount, Application Date), regardless of which columns were visible in the table.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `handleExport` function in `loan-applications-content.jsx` to dynamically export ALL visible columns
- Added intelligent column detection using `table.getVisibleFlatColumns()`
- Added proper formatting for different data types (currency, dates, employment types, etc.)
- Added CSV-safe string handling (escaping quotes and commas)
- Excluded non-data columns (select checkboxes, actions)

### 2. No Horizontal Scrolling When Many Columns Visible
**Problem**: When users enabled more columns using the "View" button, the table became cramped and users couldn't scroll horizontally to see all columns.

**Solution**:
- Added `overflow-x-auto` wrapper to the DataTable component
- Added `min-w-full` class to the table for proper width handling
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` and `min-w-[100px]` to table headers and cells
- Ensured proper column spacing and readability

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/ui/table/data-table.jsx`
- Added horizontal scrolling wrapper
- Improved column styling for better visibility
- Added minimum width constraints

### 2. `/src/features/loan-management/components/loan-applications-content.jsx`
- Completely rewrote the `handleExport` function
- Added dynamic column detection
- Added intelligent data formatting
- Added proper CSV encoding

### 3. `/src/features/loan-management/components/loan-applications-data-table.jsx`
- Modified `handleExportData` to pass the table instance to export function
- This enables the export function to access column visibility state

## Key Features Added

### Enhanced CSV Export
- **Dynamic Column Export**: Exports only the columns that are currently visible
- **Intelligent Formatting**: 
  - Currency fields formatted as Indian Rupees (â‚¹)
  - Dates formatted consistently
  - Employment types properly capitalized
  - Document and payment counts shown as numbers
- **CSV Safety**: Proper escaping of quotes and commas in text fields
- **Better File Naming**: Includes current date in filename

### Improved Table UX
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Users can now scroll right to see additional columns
- **Better Column Spacing**: Minimum width prevents columns from being too cramped
- **Non-breaking Headers**: Headers don't wrap to maintain readability

## How to Use

1. **Enable More Columns**: Click the "View" button in the table toolbar to show/hide columns
2. **Horizontal Scrolling**: When many columns are visible, scroll horizontally within the table area
3. **Export**: Click "Export" button to download CSV with all currently visible columns

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Export**: No more missing data in exports
2. **User-Controlled Export**: Users decide what columns to export by toggling visibility
3. **Better Table Navigation**: No more cramped columns when viewing many fields
4. **Professional CSV Output**: Properly formatted and Excel-compatible CSV files
