# Authentication Security - Cookie-Based (Not localStorage)

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Application Uses Secure Cookie-Based Authentication

This application **DOES NOT** use localStorage for authentication. It uses **httpOnly cookies** which are more secure.

## Security Implementation

### 1. **Token Storage: httpOnly Cookies** ✅
- Tokens are stored in **httpOnly cookies** on the server side
- Cookies are **NOT accessible via JavaScript** (prevents XSS attacks)
- Tokens are **automatically sent with requests** via `withCredentials: true`

**Evidence:**
- `src/lib/axios.js` lines 46, 57, 67: `withCredentials: true`
- `src/redux/auth/authSlice.js` line 69: `state.token = null; // Token is in httpOnly cookie`
- `src/redux/auth/authSlice.js` lines 72, 100: Comments say "No need to store in localStorage"

### 2. **Redux Persist Configuration** ✅
- Redux persist is configured to **NOT persist auth state**
- `whitelist: []` means NO state is saved to localStorage

**Evidence:**
- `src/redux/store.js` line 29: `whitelist: []` - Empty whitelist
- `src/redux/store.js` line 28: Comment: "SECURITY: Don't persist auth state - using httpOnly cookies instead"

### 3. **Auth Slice Configuration** ✅
- Auth state is explicitly cleared on rehydration
- Token is always set to `null` in Redux (stored in cookies instead)

**Evidence:**
- `src/redux/auth/authSlice.js` lines 39-48: On REHYDRATE, sets user/token to null
- `src/redux/auth/authSlice.js` lines 69, 97: `state.token = null` after login/signup

## What About localStorage References?

### Development/Testing Files Only:
1. **`src/lib/mock-auth.js`** (line 59)
   - Only used for mocking during development
   - Not used in production

2. **`src/components/storage-test.jsx`** (line 34)
   - Testing component only shown in development
   - Used to debug storage issues

**These do NOT affect production authentication.**

## How Authentication Works

```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. Server sends httpOnly cookie with JWT token
   ↓
3. Browser stores cookie (NOT accessible to JavaScript)
   ↓
4. All requests automatically include cookie (withCredentials: true)
   ↓
5. Server validates token from cookie
   ↓
6. Redux only stores user info (NOT the token)
```

## Benefits of Cookie-Based Auth

✅ **More Secure**: Tokens not accessible via JavaScript (XSS protection)
✅ **Automatic**: Cookies sent automatically with every request
✅ **httpOnly**: Cannot be read by malicious scripts
✅ **Secure Flag**: Can be set to only send over HTTPS
✅ **SameSite**: Can prevent CSRF attacks

## Verification

To verify no tokens in localStorage, check browser DevTools:
1. Open Application/Storage tab
2. Check localStorage
3. You should see `persist:root` with empty whitelist (no auth data)
4. Auth token is in Cookies tab (httpOnly, not accessible to JS)
