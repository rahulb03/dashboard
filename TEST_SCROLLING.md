# Table Scrolling Fix Test

## What was done:

1. **Simplified container structure**: 
   - Removed conflicting overflow containers
   - Used single `overflow-x-scroll` container

2. **Fixed table sizing**:
   - Table uses `min-w-max` to expand as needed
   - Each cell has `minWidth: 150px` to prevent compression
   - Headers have `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent wrapping

3. **Added visible scrollbar**:
   - Custom scrollbar styling for better visibility

## How to test:

1. Go to the loan applications page
2. Click the "View" button in the table toolbar
3. Enable many columns (PAN, Aadhar, Date of Birth, etc.)
4. You should now be able to scroll horizontally in the table area
5. The scrollbar should be visible at the bottom of the table
6. All columns should maintain proper width without being compressed

## Key changes:
- `src/components/ui/table/data-table.jsx` - Main scrolling fix
- `src/components/ui/table.jsx` - Simplified base table component
- Removed complex column sizing logic that was causing issues

The table should now scroll horizontally when there are more columns than can fit on screen.
